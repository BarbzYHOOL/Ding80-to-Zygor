# Ding80-to-Zygor
Translating Ding80's leveling guide to work in the Zygor leveling guide addon  
Discord: https://discord.gg/SjXbNRX

Open addon setting panel, goto zygor, goto dynamic progress, untick "mark obsolete steps" and "skip obsolete steps" and set "Allow levels ahead" to 80.  
Ding80 makes you do green / yellow quests, and you usually outlevel the mobs you fight.

Some minor edits to the route have been made underway.  
Particular case is when Ding80 skips "Colonel Kurzen" in STV part 2.  
I included this as ding80 also skips the "Jungle Secrets" questline in entirely, even tho "Bookie Herod" can be completed alongside "Bad Medicing"/"The Second Rebellion"  
In total it's 10920xp from quests just from heading back into the cave one more time after turning in "Special Forces".  

Ding steps can be safely ignored for the most part, it's a rough estimate of where you should be.  
Exception being level 20 before heading to redridge mountain.  

Warlocks learn succubus at lvl ~32  
Warlocks learn felhunter at lvl ~38  

Only Dwarf/Gnome starting area translated, either use Zygor default or some kind soul help me out on those.  

Progress:  
Dun Morogh 1-13 done  
Alliance 13-20 done, except druid water form questline, it fits into late westfall questing and it's written into Zygor's. A huge grind section (~8k xp) at the end of lvl 19; any quests missed? cloth capitol quests or a detour to Darkshore maybe?  
Alliance 20-24 done  
Alliance 25-29 done  
Alliance 30-34 done  
Alliance 35-39 done  
Alliance 40-44 done  
Alliance 45-49 done  
Alliance 50-54 done  
Alliance 55-58 done  

guide todo:  
forgot to add ding 34,35,47,49  
maybe include orb of orahil questline for warlocks during desolace part? can pick up the quests after getting felhunter and combine with Reagents for Reclaimers inc part 3 and 4  
Need Angus Stern's prequest to Theramore somehow, The guide takes you to the inn he is in, but worried it's to early w.r.t level reqs. Anyone testing comment on this when you pick up James Hyal in Stormwind!!! Seach for "TODO: MORGAN STERN" in the guide  
Missing Diplomat finale should be instant?  
An OOX of Your Own should be instant?  
Adding "Kill 'Em With Sleep Deprivation" and "Look at the Size of It!" when they are fixed in trinity and/or azeroth core  
Need to redo the entire hearth usage, especially 50-58 section, lots of setting hearth stone here and there and never using it.  
Possibly "Dousing the Flames of Protection" and "Ancient Spirits" can be skipped, finished lvl 58 with 52685xp (31%), aim to end at timbermaw hold with the ritual totems + runecloth (need to make a note to save runecloth)  

I'm running through the guide on a personal trinity server.
