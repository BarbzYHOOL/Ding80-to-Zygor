# Ding80-to-Zygor
Translating Ding80's leveling guide to work in the Zygor leveling guide addon  
Discord: https://discord.gg/SjXbNRX  

## Edits done to Ding80
Auberdine added for lvl 19-20  
Cracking Maury's Foot and Mai'Zoth added.  
Desolace has been replaced by Arathi Highlands.  
Removed Foreman Razelcraz questline, not worth the hassle of stepping into horde territory, hellfire slightly reorganized because of this.  
Removed Withered Basidium, to much grind.

## Progress
Dun Morogh 1-12 done  
Alliance 13-68 done  

## Guide todo
**Vanilla**  
Do a timed run compare of grinding lvl 19 in westfall or heading to auberdine as is written.  
Thelsamar blood sausage needs to be completed earlier, loss of xp due to gray.  
Make some waypoints inside Deadmines for Collecting memories and Oh brother...  
Tempted to add The Absent Minded Professor questline, hooks into wetlands and all that.  
Clean up Forest Song quest start and end route.  
Add Bartolo's Yeti fur cloak  
Adding "Kill 'Em With Sleep Deprivation" and "Look at the Size of It!" when they are fixed in trinity and/or azeroth core.  
Add druid water form questline, it fits into late westfall questing and it's written into Zygor's.

## TBCduo
This is a version of the guide tuned for 2 people leveling together doing more quest and some dungeons.  
It stays as long as possible in Azeroth to reach 70 early and get more money from questing in Netherstorm/Shadowmoon Valley

## Fixing step comments.
Don't worry about the step comments, just run `python step_fix.py <guide>` and it'll fix it for you.
