# Ding80-to-Zygor
Translating Ding80's leveling guide to work in the Zygor leveling guide addon  

Some minor edits to the route have been made underway.  
Particular case is when Ding80 skips "Colonel Kurzen" in STV part 2.  
I included this as ding80 also skips the "Jungle Secrets" questline in entirely, even tho "Bookie Herod" can be completed alongside "Bad Medicing"/"The Second Rebellion"  
In total it's 10920xp from quests just from heading back into the cave one more time after turning in "Special Forces".  

Ding steps can be safely ignored for the most part, it's a rough estimate of where you should be.  
Exception being level 20 before heading to redridge mountain.  

Warlocks learn succubus at lvl ~32  
Warlocks learn felhunter at lvl ~38  

Only Dwarf/Gnome starting area translated, either use Zygor default or some kind soul help me out on those.  

Progress:  
Dun Morogh 1-13 done  
Alliance 13-20 done, except druid water form questline, a huge grind section at the end of lvl 19; any quests missed, cloth capitol quests maybe?  
Alliance 20-24 done  
Alliance 25-29 done  
Alliance 30-34 done  
Alliance 35-39 done  

guide todo:  
forgot to add ding 34 and 35  
maybe include orb of orahil questline for warlocks during desolace part? can pick up the quests after getting felhunter and combine with Reagents for Reclaimers inc part 3 and 4  
Need Angus Stern's prequest to Theramore somehow, The guide takes you to the inn he is in, but worried it's to early w.r.t level reqs. Anyone testing comment on this when you pick up James Hyal in Stormwind!!! Seach for "TODO: MORGAN STERN" in the guide  
Missing Diplomat finale should be instant?

I'm running through the guide on a personal trinity server.
