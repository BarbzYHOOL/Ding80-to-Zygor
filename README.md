Desolace has been replaced by Arathi Highlands.  


## Tips
Warlocks learn voidwalker at lvl 15  
Warlocks learn succubus at lvl 32  
Warlocks learn felhunter at lvl 38

## Progress
Dun Morogh 1-12 done  
Alliance 13-19 done, except druid water form questline, it fits into late westfall questing and it's written into Zygor's.
Alliance 20-24 done  
Alliance 25-29 done  
Alliance 30-34 done  
Alliance 35-39 done  
Alliance 40-44 done  
Alliance 45-49 done  
Alliance 50-54 done  
Alliance 55-58 done  

## Guide todo
Do a timed run compare of grinding lvl 19 in westfall or heading to auberdine as is written.

Thelsamar blood sausage needs to be completed earlier, loss of xp due to gray.
Make some waypoints inside Deadmines for Collecting memories and Oh brother...
Tempted to add The Absent Minded Professor questline, hooks into wetlands and all that.

An OOX of Your Own should be instant?  
Adding "Kill 'Em With Sleep Deprivation" and "Look at the Size of It!" when they are fixed in trinity and/or azeroth core
Need to redo the entire hearth usage, especially 50-58 section, lots of setting hearth stone here and there and never using it.  
"Dousing the Flames of Protection" and "Ancient Spirits" can possibly be skipped, finished lvl 58 with 52685xp (31%), aim to end at timbermaw hold with the ritual totems + runecloth (need to make a note to save runecloth)
