# Ding80-to-Zygor
Translating Ding80's leveling guide to work in the Zygor leveling guide addon  
Discord: https://discord.gg/SjXbNRX  

## Edits done to Ding80
Auberdine added for lvl 19-20  
Cracking Maury's Foot and Mai'Zoth added.  
Desolace has been replaced by Arathi Highlands.  
Removed Foreman Razelcraz questline, not worth the hassle of stepping into horde territory.  
Removed Withered Basidium, to much grind.

## Progress
Dun Morogh 1-5 done  
Elwynn Forest 1-5 done  
Eastern Kingdoms 6-12 done  
Alliance 13-68 done  

## Ding steps
The guide is a work in progress,
most ding steps are advisory at best unless explicitly stated otherwise,
feel free to skip it if you have clear goals right after.

## Guide todo
**Vanilla**  
lvl 10 class quests for everyone except gnome warlock and human, gnome and dwarf warrior.  
Do a timed run compare of grinding lvl 19 in westfall or heading to auberdine as is written.  
Thelsamar blood sausage needs to be completed earlier, loss of xp due to gray.  
Make some waypoints inside Deadmines for Collecting memories and Oh brother...  
Tempted to add The Absent Minded Professor questline, hooks into wetlands and all that.  
Clean up Forest Song quest start and end route.  
Add Bartolo's Yeti fur cloak  
Adding "Kill 'Em With Sleep Deprivation" and "Look at the Size of It!" when they are fixed in trinity and/or azeroth core.  
Add druid water form questline, it fits into late westfall questing and it's written into Zygor's.

## TBCduo
This is a version of the guide tuned for a gnome/dwarf pair leveling together on a TBC server doing more quests than usual and some dungeons.
It stays as long as possible in Azeroth to reach 70 early and get more money from questing in Netherstorm/Shadowmoon Valley later.  
This version uses a new tag called noauto, make sure your Zygor supports this.

## Fixing step comments.
Don't worry about the step comments, just run `python step_fix.py <guide>` and it'll fix it for you.

## How I write the guides
I host a private TrinityCore or AzerothCore server and run around as a gm writing the guide as I go along.
I use these keybinded macros. (warning: this might ruin your usual leveling experience ;)
