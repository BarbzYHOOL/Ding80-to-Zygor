Colonel Kurzen and full Jungle Secrets chain is added.  
Desolace has been replaced by Arathi Highlands.  

## Tips
Warlocks learn succubus at lvl ~32  
Warlocks learn felhunter at lvl ~38

## Progress
Dun Morogh 1-12 done  
Alliance 13-20 done, except druid water form questline, it fits into late westfall questing and it's written into Zygor's. A huge grind section (~8k xp) at the end of lvl 19; any quests missed? cloth capitol quests or a detour to Darkshore maybe?  
Alliance 20-24 done  
Alliance 25-29 done  
Alliance 30-34 done  
Alliance 35-39 done  
Alliance 40-44 done  
Alliance 45-49 done  
Alliance 50-54 done  
Alliance 55-58 done  

## Guide todo
An OOX of Your Own should be instant?  
Adding "Kill 'Em With Sleep Deprivation" and "Look at the Size of It!" when they are fixed in trinity and/or azeroth core
Need to redo the entire hearth usage, especially 50-58 section, lots of setting hearth stone here and there and never using it.  
"Dousing the Flames of Protection" and "Ancient Spirits" can possibly be skipped, finished lvl 58 with 52685xp (31%), aim to end at timbermaw hold with the ritual totems + runecloth (need to make a note to save runecloth)  

## Fixing step comments.
Don't worry about the step comments, just run `python step_fix.py <guide>` and it'll fix it for you.
